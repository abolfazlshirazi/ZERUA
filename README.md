Zerua is a web-based space simulator for modeling satellite orbits and trajectories. It provides interactive 3D visualizations, real-world satellite data, and advanced orbital mechanics tools—all within an intuitive interface. 

## ✨ Features

- 🛰️ **3D Interactive Visualization** – Simulate space trajectories, and manipulate orbits in real-time.
- 📡 **Real Satellite Data** – Access a full database of Two-Line Element (TLE) satellite data, updated daily.
- 📈 **Numerical Orbit Analysis** – Compute and visualize orbital parameters, ground tracks, and more.
- 🧩 **Extensible** – Built for the community, with room for enhancements and contributions.

## 🌐 Prerequisites
Zerua is an online web-based tool. Users only need a modern web browser to access and use the tool—no installation or additional software required.

## 🚀 Orbit Simulation

**ZERUA** repository is the official GitHub home of [ZERUA](https://www.zerua.space), where we merge **astrodynamics**, **AI**, and **evolutionary computation** to push the boundaries of spacecraft trajectory optimization and simulation. This repository hosts a range of simulations related to space engineering and orbital mechanics. Our systems are built for both scientific exploration and educational dissemination.

### 📦 Folder Structure

- [`/Simulations/`](./Simulations)  
   Explore hundreds of simulation cases showcasing optimal orbit transfers around Earth. Each simulation includes visualizations, thrust profiles, fuel usage plots, and more.
- [`/Simulations/Low-Thrust/`](./Simulations/Low-Thrust)  
   Trajectory optimization cases involving low-thrust propulsion and fuel-optimal transfers using advanced AI and evolutionary algorithms.

### 🚀 Simulation Videos

Explore our growing library of **spacecraft transfer simulations** categorized by themes and optimization strategies. All simulations demonstrate fuel-optimal low-thrust maneuvers around Earth, achieved using our proprietary **AI-driven evolutionary algorithms**.

📺 These simulations are featured in weekly videos on our  
🔗 [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@zeruatech) in the  
🎬 Playlist: **[Low-Thrust Space Trajectory Design and Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJMfURpxHVVkWjTQBiavZLb4bVetN_96z)**
