# Simulations at ZERUA

Welcome to the **Simulations** section of the ZERUA platform!  
This is where we present the results of our large-scale optimization experiments in the form of **visually-rich, AI-optimized spacecraft trajectory simulations**.

## 📁 Simulation Categories

Our simulations are grouped by type and method. Each category represents a thematic playlist on the [Zerua Tech YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@zeruatech). Each folder contains:

- 🚀 Input and output data
- 🧠 Algorithm details
- 📈 Plots and performance metrics
- 📹 Video-ready visuals

### 🛰 Current Simulation Categories

- [`Low-Thrust/`](./Low-Thrust)  
   Trajectory optimization cases involving low-thrust propulsion and fuel-optimal transfers using advanced AI and evolutionary algorithms.

### 🔮 Future Categories (Coming Soon)

- `Orbit Propagation/` — Pure orbital evolution without maneuvers  
- `Maneuver Planning/` — Impulsive and hybrid maneuvers  
- `Satellite Constellation/` — Optimization for multiple satellites  
- `Perturbation Analysis/` — Effects of real-world forces like drag and J2
