# 🔥 Low-Thrust Spacecraft Transfer Simulations

This folder contains simulation cases for **fuel-optimal, low-thrust orbital transfers** around Earth.

All simulations here are powered by **AI-driven evolutionary algorithms**, developed in-house by Zerua Tech. These cases represent optimal transfers from one orbit to another using a low-thrust propulsion system, focusing on **maximum propellant efficiency** rather than time minimization.

## 🎥 Playlist:  Low-Thrust Space Trajectory Design and Optimization  
Each case is featured in a 2–5 minute high-resolution simulation video on our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJMfURpxHVVkWjTQBiavZLb4bVetN_96z).

## 📦 Folder Structure

Each subfolder (e.g., `SIM-00166-00032`) includes:
- 📄 Overview and metadata  
- 🛰 Input conditions (initial/final orbits, mass, thrust, Isp)  
- 📈 Simulation outputs (orbital elements, mass usage, thrust logic)  
- 🎞 Link to the simulation video
- 📁 Numerical data
